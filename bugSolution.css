To fix this, ensure the parent element of the `div` has its width explicitly set.  For example:

```css
div.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Or any specific width */
}
div.child {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This ensures that the browser can accurately compute the width of the `div` based on the parent's known dimensions.  Alternatively, consider using a flexbox or grid layout for more robust width management.
