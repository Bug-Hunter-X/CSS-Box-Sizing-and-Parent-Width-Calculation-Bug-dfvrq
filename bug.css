The following CSS rule may cause unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This rule attempts to make the `div` element fill its parent container's width. The `box-sizing: border-box;` property is then used to include padding and border widths within the element's total width. However, if the `div`'s parent doesn't have its width explicitly set, some browsers may struggle to calculate the `div`'s width correctly.
